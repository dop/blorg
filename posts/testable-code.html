<i>Reading time: up to 10 years</i>.

<p>
"Guide: Writing Testable Code"<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> series from Miško Hevery of AngularJS fame resonated with me. It has a nice balance of theory and practice.
</p>

<p>
I read this pretty long document and watched Google Tech Talks on testable code<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> because my career as front-end developer started with AngularJS<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. The great thing about it is the architecture which encourages testable code. It took me a couple of years to appreciate what AngularJS offered. The moment I started to really grasp its potential the world turned to React. Oh well. Luckily, guiding principles laid out in Miško's articles are universal.
</p>

<p>
My hope with this article is to channel Miško's ideas and give you, dear reader, cognitive tools to recognize untestable code.
</p>

<p>
<i>Note</i>: In this article I will be using TypeScript and JavaScript code as examples, but rules are universal and can be applied to other languages. Even purely functional ones. But to be fair, purely functional languages, like Elm, makes it really hard to write untestable code.
</p>

<h2 id="Overview-of-Guide-Writing-Testable-Code"><a href="#Overview-of-Guide-Writing-Testable-Code">Overview of "Guide: Writing Testable Code"</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org058632b">
<p>
"Guide: Writing Testable Code" was written as internal document at Google targeting Java code. Many of given examples are tied to Java and Dependency Injection framework Guice but the underlying ideas are applicable to both TypeScript and JavaScript nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
Guide consists of 4 parts (flaws):
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>"Constructor does Real Work"</li>
<li>"Digging into Collaborators"</li>
<li>"Brittle Global State &amp; Singletons"</li>
<li>"Class Does Too Much"</li>
</ol>

<p>
Parts 2 to 4 are obvious, but we will go through them anyway. While part 1 is definitely a common sense one, I don't think I ever saw it mentioned and pointed out so clearly before. Making your constructors dumb is important for objects to be testable. Moreover, it also has this nice consequence of forcing your app or module to have clearly separated initialization and execution phases.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Business-Logic-in-Constructors" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Business-Logic-in-Constructors"><a href="#Business-Logic-in-Constructors">Business Logic in Constructors</a></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1389bb7">
<p>
This one is my favourite. Mostly because I've never seen it articulated and written down so clearly before.
</p>

<p>
It is also very powerful as it influences code structure in fundamental way and paves the road for the rest of testable design.
</p>

<p>
The essence of the rule is to not have any logic in constructors besides setting instance variables. It follows that all your objects have to be constructed (and only constructed) at the start of your application. This phase could be understood as configuration part. Once everything is constructed and wired, execution part begins and business gets done. At this time only value (pure) objects can be created.
</p>

<p>
Applying this rule to my React projects lead to unorthodox architectures which some people found off-putting because of unfamiliar looks. The upside of it is that all of the components can be pure, easily <a href="https://storybook.js.org">storybookable</a> and testable.
</p>

<p>
Following is an example of how it might look.

const MapView = mapView(map);
// ...
const App = app(storage, MapView, ...);

ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById(... ));
</pre>
</div>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name"><span class="listing-number">Listing 2: </span>Map component.</label><pre class="src src-javascript">function mapView(map: MapServiceProvider) {
  return function MapView({longitude, latitude}) {
    const [mapUrl, setMapUrl] = useState(null);

    useEffect(async () =&gt; {
      setMapUrl(await map.getImageUrl(longitude, latitude));
    }, [longitude, latitude]);

    return &lt;div&gt;{mapUrl ? &lt;img src={mapUrl}/&gt; : SOME_DEFAULT_MAP_IMAGE}&lt;/div&gt;;
  }
}

    const coordinates = storage.getCoordinates();

    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
	// ...
	&lt;MapView {...coordinates} /&gt;
	// ...
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgad9c819">
<p>
Global state is sneaky. It hides under mutable variables, static methods, singleton objects, and any dependency that is not passed as an argument. Global state is infectious. Single instance of it in a small module will corrupt all of your application.
</p>

<p>
Singleton pattern in OOP is well spread practice, so how come it's bad? Answer is that, unless global, it is not.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at small example of sneaky global state.

fetchPosts()

  ✔ successfully fetches posts
  ✔ returns empty array and error on failure


total:     2
passing:   2
duration:  25ms


</pre>

<p>
Great success?
</p>

<p>
Not really. Even though tests have passed, we had to use proxyquire<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> to tap into module system and override dependencies. This a neat trick, but ultimately it's a sign of global state issue. Modules are singletons, they're run only once. Even though it's pretty common to see such code in the wild, it's not testable or REPL friendly.
</p>

<p>
There is another catch &#x2013; our tests are only accidentally successful. If they would run fast enough to produce the same timestamp, we would get data served from the cache, which is a singleton object for the whole application.
</p>

<p>
What does testable code look like?
</p>

<p>
First, Cache module exposes a function to create one.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name"><span class="listing-number">Listing 7: </span>Cache module.</label><pre class="src src-javascript">function Cache() {
  const store = {};

  function set(key, value) {
    return store[key] = value;
  }

  function get(key) {
    return store[key];
  }

  return {
    set,
    get,
  };
}

module.exports = Cache;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The same goes for utility to fetch posts. It's a repository object now and can be configured with all of dependencies.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name"><span class="listing-number">Listing 8: </span>Posts repository object.</label><pre class="src src-javascript">function PostsRepo(BASE_URL, fetch, cache) {
  async function query(since) {
    const timestamp = since.getTime();
    const KEY = 'posts_since_' + timestamp;
    let posts = cache.get(KEY);
    if (posts == null) {
      const response = await fetch(BASE_URL + '/posts?since=' + timestamp);
      if (response.status === 200) {
	posts = await response.json();
	cache.set(KEY, posts);
      } else {
	return {error: 'Cannot fetch posts'};
      }
    }
    return {result: posts};
  }

  return {
    query,
  }
}

module.exports = PostsRepo;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As a result, we no longer need proxyquire. It's also painfully clear, that we have a cache, and we should be careful with it.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name"><span class="listing-number">Listing 9: </span>Complicated but honest tests.</label><pre class="src src-javascript">const test = require('tape');

const Cache = require('./cache');
const PostsRepo = require('./posts-repo');

test('PostsRepo', (assert) =&gt; {
  function newPostsRepo(fetch) {
    return PostsRepo('/', fetch, Cache());
  }

  assert.test('fetch()', async () =&gt; {
    const expectedPosts = [1, 2, 3];
    const okFetch = () =&gt; Promise.resolve({
      status: 200,
      json: () =&gt; expectedPosts
    });
    assert.deepEqual(
      await newPostsRepo(okFetch).query(new Date()),
      {result: expectedPosts},
      'successfully fetches posts'
    );

    const failFetch = () =&gt; Promise.resolve({status: 500});
    assert.deepEqual(
      await newPostsRepo(failFetch).query(new Date()),
      {error: 'Cannot fetch posts'},
      'returns empty array and error on failure'
    );

    assert.end();
  });
});
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Nice consequence of ditching proxyquire is that our tests run faster.

<p>
This one is easy to spot. For example, if we see a second level access of property in your code like this
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">this.session.getAccount().getNickname()
</pre>
</div>

<p>
we have a problem. It will become clear when writing a test for it. We will have to either mock or construct <code>Account</code> in addition to <code>Session</code> in all places where <code>Session</code> is a dependency. Renaming a method of <code>Account</code> will impact places where direct dependency is <code>Session</code>, not <code>Account</code>. While most IDEs have no problem with renaming, your code repository history will become noisy.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at the following example.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">function App() {
  const session = useSession();
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;Hello, {session?.account?.name ?? 'Anonymous'}!&lt;/div&gt;
      // ...
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Instead of chains of method calls we have nested property access exhibiting the same issue. To avoid digging into <code>session</code>, we might introduce a selector <code>getAccountName</code> or pass only necessary data to child component.
</p>

<p>
Here's how second solution might look.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">function App() {
  const session = useSession();
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Greet account={session.account} /&gt;
      // ...
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Both of the solutions are related to separating concerns. To choose correct one, you need to answer a question of what exactly does component need to do its job.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7b0c4c8">
<p>
Also known as a failure to maintain single responsibility principle. Usual rule of thumb is to look for names containing "and". But I find this problematic as some people are good (or bad) at naming. It is possible to name <code>PersistentCache</code> as <code>CacheAndSave</code>, but it does not mean that former is good and latter is bad. It's hard to come up with example that is not ridiculous, but here we go.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">function UserRepo(store, mailer) {
  return {
    list() {
      return store.fetch('user:*');
    },
    fetch(id) {
      return store.fetch('user:' + id);
    },
    async update(id, data) {
      const old = await this.fetch(id);
      const result = await store.save('user:' + data.id, data);
      if (old.email != data.email) {
	await mailer.confirmEmail(id, data.email);
      }
      return result;
    },
    async save(data) {
      const id = await store.nextId();
      const result = await store.save('user:' + id, data);
      await mailer.confirmEmail(id, data.email);
      return result;
    }
  };
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Besides the funky key value store, we have repository initiating email confirmation. On its own, this only feels wrong, but might be completely benign. Why does it feel wrong? First, <code>mailer</code> is used only in two of four methods. Maybe it would make sense to split <code>UserRepo</code> into reader and writer parts? Queries and commands? Invocation of confirmation flow also raises some questions. Since we are passing user ID, is <code>mailer</code> supposed to understand it's meaning? Will we have to encode confirmation link inside <code>mailer</code>? Does it mean that <code>mailer</code> will have to understand routing? Oh my&#x2026; It seems that <code>mailer</code> is not supposed to be here, and its interface has to be different.
</p>

<p>
Where should we put it? Let's help ourselves by imagining that we also have account registration form, and profile view. Now, <code>mailer</code> makes sense in a registration form, but profile screen does not need it. So we are going to move <code>mailer</code> to registration handler (a.k.a. controller). It makes sense that request handler knows how to construct links, thus we can build email message with confirmation URL there. We'll pass it to <code>mailer</code> via generic interface, for example <code>mailer.send(recepients, subject, body)</code>.
</p>

<p>
To solve this puzzle of responsibilities, we asked some questions and gave ourselves hypothetical answers. In real world, question will have real answers, which will lead to other solutions.

After meditating on this blog post for some time I couldn't help but reflect and compare my experience with React and AngularJS. There's still a place in my heart for Angular's principled testable design, but it definitely loses by having overly complicated templating layer. And that is the part front-end developers spend most of the time on.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, while it's very easy<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> to start with React, unprincipled developers would soon find themselves in a mess of global state and monolithic untestable application. It's not React's fault, but, I guess, it missed out on pedagogical opportunity.
</p>

<p>
If you find yourself overwhelmed by multitude of state management solutions, latest React developments, or just general JavaScript fatigue, just know that you're not alone. I'm with you! We are two unique snowflakes, like two React codebases, vastly different because started on different weeks. Trends will pass, but those 4 pitfalls we just learned about will still be there. Let's stay vigilant and keep our code testable and evolvable<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>.
